# 📘 Jupyter Notebook Parser
### 🚀 A Streamlit app that extracts Python code from Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) and saves them as separate .py files based on `##` section headers.

🔹 Features
- 📂 Upload Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) and extract code sections.
- 🔍 Detects ## headers and organizes content into separate Python scripts.
- 📝 Optional Markdown Inclusion – Choose to include Markdown cells in the output.
- 📌 Custom Filenames – Save sections using either sequential names or section titles.
- 📦 Download as ZIP – Export all extracted sections in a compressed .zip file.


🔹 🆕 Upcoming Enhancements
- 🚀 `Custom Templates:` Users can define templates for output files, including headers, footers, and formatting.
- 📂 `Batch Processing:` Upload and process multiple notebooks at once for efficiency.
- 🌙 `Dark Mode:` Toggle dark mode for a better user experience.
- ⚠️ `File Size Warning:` Receive alerts for large file uploads.
- ✏️ `Interactive Previews:` Edit or modify extracted sections before downloading.

🔹 🎯 How It Works
Upload your .ipynb file.
Choose your preferences (include Markdown, use section titles as filenames, etc.).
Download a ZIP file containing .py scripts for each section.

🔹 🛠️ Technologies Used
Streamlit – Interactive UI.
